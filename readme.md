# Waveform Visualiser
Visualises multiple configurable waveforms (Sine, square, triangle, sawtooth). I made this to become more familiar with CuPy, FastPlotLib, and ImGui.

Almost fully GPU accelerated.

## Configurable Options:
 - Frequency
 - Amplitude
 - Speed
 - Resolution/number of points per line (can crank this so that it doesn't get all jagged with high frequencies, but be aware of memory usage)
