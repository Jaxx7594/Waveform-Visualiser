# Waveform Visualiser
Visualises multiple configurable waveforms (Sine, square, triangle, sawtooth). I made this to become more familiar with CuPy, FastPlotLib, and ImGui.

Almost fully GPU accelerated.

## Features:
 - Frequency control
 - Amplitude control
 - Speed control
 - Resolution/number of points per line control (can crank this so that it doesn't get all jagged with high frequencies, but be aware of memory usage)
 - Navigatable (can zoom, pan, etc)
